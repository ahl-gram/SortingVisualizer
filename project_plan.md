            }
            if array[j] > array[j + 1] {
                array.swapAt(j, j + 1)
                // Animate swap
                await MainActor.run {
                    animateSwap(index1: j, index2: j + 1)
                }
            }
            // Delay adjusted using animationSpeed
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(animationSpeed * 1_000_000_000))
        }
    }
    await MainActor.run {
        markAsSorted()

### Task 11: Real-Time UI Updates for Bar States

**Description:**  
Update the UI in real time to highlight bars being compared, swapped, or marked as sorted using `SortingBarView`. Centralize state updates in a view model if necessary.

*Code snippet/command:*

```swift
// During a comparison:
withAnimation {
    bars[j].state = .comparing
    bars[j+1].state = .comparing
}
// After comparison/swap:
withAnimation {
    bars[j].state = .unsorted  // or .sorted if the element is in its final position
    bars[j+1].state = .unsorted
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Bars change state (color) during active comparisons and swaps: changing to green when comparing and reverting to white or changing to cyan when set as sorted.
- Accessibility improvements (e.g., announcements or haptics) may be added in later iterations.

**Test Plan:**

*Manual Test Plan:*
1. Perform a sort animation and verify that the color transitions match the bar states.
2. Validate that the changes are smooth and visually distinct.

*Automated Test Plan:*
- Unit tests for state transition functions within the view model.

Integrate audio feedback using AVFoundation. Based on each bar’s height, play a corresponding musical tone when that bar is accessed during the sorting process. Consider error and performance handling.

*Code snippet/command:*

```swift
import AVFoundation

var audioEngine: AVAudioEngine?
var tonePlayer: AVAudioPlayerNode?

func playTone(forValue value: Int) {
    // Calculate frequency based on the bar's height/value (e.g., higher height -> higher pitch)
    let frequency = 220.0 + Double(value) * 5.0
    // Setup and play tone. In production, cache/generate audio buffers efficiently.
    // Handle potential errors or unavailable audio hardware.
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Tones are played with pitches correlating to bar values during each access (comparison or swap).
- Audio processing is efficient and non-blocking.

**Test Plan:**

*Manual Test Plan:*
1. Run the sorting visualization and ensure the audio tones correspond to bar heights.
2. Test with and without audio hardware if possible.

*Automated Test Plan:*
- Use unit tests/mocks to verify that the audio function is invoked with the correct frequency.
- Monitor performance metrics if audio processing slows down the UI.

*Code snippet/command:*

```swift
struct SafeAreaViewModifier: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .padding(.top, UIApplication.shared.windows.first?.safeAreaInsets.top ?? 0)
    }
}

extension View {
    func avoidDynamicIsland() -> some View {
        self.modifier(SafeAreaViewModifier())
    }
}
```

Apply this modifier to your main view:

```swift
ContentView()
    .avoidDynamicIsland()
```

func markAsSorted() {
    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0)) {
        for index in bars.indices {
            bars[index].state = .sorted
        }
    }
    // Optionally trigger haptic feedback here.
}
```
